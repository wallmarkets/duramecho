Sure, I could narrow my brower's window, but when you opened ten or so of them, browser has to render them again and again. As an option, I could open the new window to do so, but I can't take the child from his family. ðŸ˜…

# P.S.

Nowadays I learn some basic stuff in HTML/CSS, and am trying to get myself into Git. That's the second reason. Also, I'm in love with stuff like memory management. I don't know why, it's like that's right challenge for me. And Google linked to the article.
