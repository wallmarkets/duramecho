Style.css file for http://duramecho.com

# Why?

I really liked few articles published there, but it was really painful to read them in 27' screen, its width across the screen. Sure, I could narrow my brower's windows, but when you opened ten or so of them, browser has to render them again and again. As an option, I could open the new window to do so, but I can't take the child from his family. ðŸ˜… 

# Result?

I added few basic lines of styles in main style.css file. And I saved the result.
